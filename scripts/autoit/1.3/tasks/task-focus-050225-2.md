5. We discussed creting an AutoIt app to either itterate through a gui choosable subfolder category of models while systematically running the command line with the models while testing the usable range by examining stdout and storing the range in an array in the ini dynamically. This should also be able to be done with a single selectable model,  a range of ctrl or shift selections. a models subfolder or the whole models folder.
