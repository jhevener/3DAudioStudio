## Initial Conversation
- Thank you, Lets proceed one step at a time through these recommendations and then let's get programming! Yee hah!
- I think we need to update the template: [Original template content follows]

## Recommendations (From Grok)
1. **Implement Versioning in Git**
   - Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/update-script-v2.44`).
   - Tag releases (e.g., `v2.43`, `v2.44`).
   - Make granular commits for each change.
2. **Implement Versioning in SciTE**
   - Add version comments in the script (`Version: 2.43`).
   - Rename script with version numbers (e.g., `3DAudioStudioSeparator_2.44.au3`).
   - Enable SciTE backups.
3. **Test Before Updating**
   - Run Au3Check before and after changes.
   - Test runtime functionality incrementally.
4. **Document Dependencies and Paths**
   - Create `docs/dependencies.md` to list dependencies like Demucs, BASS, SQLite.
   - Hardcode paths temporarily to avoid path-related issues.
5. **Automate Testing with a Batch Script**
   - Create a batch script to run Au3Check and the script for quick testing.
6. **Plan Script Updates**
   - Prioritize fixes: #include paths, Demucs integration, SQLite connectivity.

## Todayâ€™s Tasks
