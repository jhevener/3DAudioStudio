## Initial Conversation
User provided access to the restructured public repository at https://github.com/jhevener/3DAudioStudio.

Focus on AudioWizardSeparator_1.2.au3:
Working GUI and Demucs separation routine, but reports an error before completion. Logs are saved for debugging.

Need to test two other separation routines in the script.

Incorporate 5 new parameter fields from the revised INI into the script.

AudioWizardSeparatorDbBrowser_1.1.au3 creates the new database from the updated INI.

Test scripts exist but are unsuccessful; best one needs troubleshooting after debugging the current script.

## Recommendations
Prioritize debugging the error in AudioWizardSeparator_1.2.au3 using saved logs.

Test and validate all separation routines to ensure full functionality.

Update the script to handle new INI parameters seamlessly.

After completing the above, select the most promising test script for troubleshooting.

Maintain clear version control with commits and tags for each major change.
